    <h2>Quick chilli</h2>
    <p>By <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/author/goodfood">Good Food team</a></p>

    <p>"Chili is not so much food as a state of mind. Addictions to it are formed early in life and the victims never
        recover. On blue days in October, I get this passionate yearning for a bowl of chili, and I nearly lose my mind.
        â€” Margaret Cousins"</p><br>
    <p>This fast and filling chilli is great served with rice or piled high onto a baked potato and dolloped with soured
        cream</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1100g chorizo , sliced</li>
        <li>350g tub fresh tomato and chilli sauce (we used Waitrose)</li>
        <li>400g can kidney beans , rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>400g can chickpea , rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>rice and natural yogurt, or jacket potatoes and soured cream, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry-fry the chorizo for a few mins in a non-stick frying pan until crisp. Carefully pour off any fat from
            the pan, then tip in the sauce and beans with 100ml water. Bring to a simmer, cover, then lower the heat and
            bubble for 10 mins. Spoon over rice and serve with yogurt</li>
    </ol>
